This is a placeholder favicon file. Replace with a proper .ico binary if you want an image.

You can generate a proper favicon using an image editor or an online converter and
place the binary ICO file here. For now this placeholder prevents 404 requests
from the browser when it tries to fetch /favicon.ico.
